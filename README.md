# DSA Problem Solutions (C++)

This repository contains my **C++ solutions to data structures and algorithms problems** solved across **multiple competitive programming and interview platforms** (such as LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, etc.).

I am using this repository as a **central, structured log** of my problem-solving journey — revisiting fundamentals, refining approaches, and writing clean, interview-ready solutions.

## 🌱 About This Repository

* Structured DSA practice across **multiple platforms**
* Focus on **patterns, concepts, and optimal approaches**
* Solutions written in **clean, readable C++ (C++17)**
* Problems organized by **data structure / algorithmic technique**
* Older solutions may be revisited and improved over time

## 🧠 Solution Format

Each solution file follows this format:

```cpp
/*
Platform: LeetCode / Codeforces / CodeChef / AtCoder
Problem: <problem_name or id>
Approach: <brief description>
Time Complexity: O(...)
Space Complexity: O(...)
*/

// #include <libraries>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // solution code
};
```

* Solutions prioritize clarity and correctness
* Written to be **interview-ready**

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Strengthen **DSA fundamentals** across platforms
* Master common **problem-solving patterns**
* Build consistency in writing clean, optimal solutions
* Prepare for **software engineering & quant interviews**

---

## 🚀 Progress

This repository will be updated regularly as I solve and revisit problems.

## 📌 Note

This is a learning-focused repository. Solutions may be optimized, refactored, or rewritten as my understanding improves.
